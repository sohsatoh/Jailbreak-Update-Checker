# Jailbreak Update Checker

Jailbreak Update Checker is a tweak to check for and do jailbreak updates automatically

## What's this?

This tweak checks for updates to your jailbreak at respring and once every 24 hours (automatically).

If an update is available, you will be alerted and you can update by tapping "Update".

Also, if for some reason you do not have a network connection and cannot check, the check will be added to a queue and updates will be checked as soon as a network connection becomes available.

## Support

- iOS 14 : Taurine Jailbreak only (If other jailbreaks support on-device updates, I will consider supporting them.)

## Build

Just build using Theos

## License

CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

(I will generally allow other developers to improve this, but I'm using this license setting in case other pirate repositories make harmful copies.)
